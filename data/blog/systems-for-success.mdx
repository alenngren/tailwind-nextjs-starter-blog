## The Setup

High course load. Job applications. Life.

Every minute counts. Friction is the enemy.

So I built a system.

## The Structure

- All simulations, data processing, and plots live in `/code`
- The report pulls figures and results *directly* from code output
- No manual copying, no reformatting, no "final version" panic
- Everything runs locally and offline

Once this is set up, iteration becomes cheap:

- change code → regenerate figures → report updates
- no context switching
- no tooling fights

## The Pain Point I Didn't See at First

Before setting this up, I thought most of my time was spent on "hard problems."

It wasn't.

A surprising amount of effort went into:
- adjusting figure layouts
- renaming files
- re-exporting plots
- making the report look "right" instead of *making progress*

Only after automating out the sameness did this become obvious.

Once the boilerplate disappeared, almost all remaining time went into **problem solving that actually moved the report forward** — deriving results, interpreting behavior, refining arguments.

The learning suddenly became the dominant term.

## Creating Capabilities

In *Peak*, Anders Ericsson argues that expertise comes from deliberate practice — focused repetition at the edge of your ability.

But here's what often gets missed: **you can only practice deliberately if the environment allows it.**

If every session starts with 30 minutes of setup, you never reach the edge. You stay in the shallows, fighting logistics.

By removing friction, the system doesn't just save time — it **creates the conditions for capability development**. Each iteration can go deeper. Each session starts where the last one ended, not back at the tooling.

Systems don't make you smarter. They let you practice where it matters.

## An Engineering Analogy

Automating away repeated steps is like **integrating out a variable** from a multivariate function.

You remove a dependency that doesn't matter for the final result, and what remains is a cleaner, more meaningful relationship.

Same workload. Fewer dimensions.
Much easier to reason about.

## Takeaway

> **Set up systems that let your attention stay where capability grows.**

Repeated friction is a design bug.
Anything you do every week is infrastructure.

Fix it once. Let it compound.
