This site documents experiments, models, and systems I build to create capabilities.

It spans statistical physics, machine learning, and computation, with an emphasis on measurement, reproducibility, and decision-making under uncertainty.

The goal is not optimization for its own sake, but understanding how constraints, data, and structure shape what systems — and people — can reliably do.
